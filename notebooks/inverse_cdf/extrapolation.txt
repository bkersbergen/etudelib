To increase the number of items while still maintaining the shape of the distribution, you can use a technique called "extrapolation". Extrapolation involves extending the distribution function beyond the range of observed data based on the assumption that the underlying distribution continues to follow the same shape.

One approach to extrapolation is to fit a curve or a function to the observed data and use it to generate probabilities for new items. For example, you can use a polynomial, an exponential function, a power law, or another mathematical function that matches the shape of the observed distribution.

Here's an example Python code that uses an exponential function to extrapolate the observed item frequencies and generate probabilities for new items:

import numpy as np
from scipy.optimize import curve_fit

# Example item frequencies
item_freq = {'A': 5.2, 'B': 8.7, 'C': 3.1, 'D': 2.9}

# Normalize the frequencies and create a sorted list of item IDs and probabilities
item_probs = np.array(list(item_freq.values())) / sum(item_freq.values())
item_ids, item_probs = zip(*sorted(zip(item_freq.keys(), item_probs)))

# Define an exponential function for extrapolation
def exp_func(x, a, b):
    return a * np.exp(b * x)

# Fit the exponential function to the observed data
x_data = np.arange(len(item_ids))
popt, _ = curve_fit(exp_func, x_data, item_probs)

# Generate probabilities for new items using the extrapolated function
new_item_ids = ['E', 'F', 'G']  # Example new item IDs
new_item_probs = exp_func(np.arange(len(item_ids), len(item_ids) + len(new_item_ids)), *popt)
new_item_probs /= sum(new_item_probs)  # Normalize the probabilities

# Combine the new item IDs and probabilities with the observed data
all_item_ids = item_ids + tuple(new_item_ids)
all_item_probs = np.concatenate((item_probs, new_item_probs))

# Create a linearly interpolated distribution function
interp_func = interp1d(np.cumsum(all_item_probs), all_item_ids, kind='linear')

# Sample from the distribution
random_num = np.random.random()
sampled_id = interp_func(random_num)

print("Sampled item ID:", sampled_id)

In this code, we first define an example item frequency dictionary item_freq. We then normalize the frequencies and create a sorted list of item IDs and probabilities using the zip() function, the sorted() function, and the * operator to unpack the zipped list. We define an exponential function exp_func() for extrapolation and use scipy.optimize.curve_fit() to fit it to the observed data. We generate probabilities for new items using the extrapolated function by applying it to a sequence of new item indices, and normalize the probabilities. We combine the new item IDs and probabilities with the observed data using tuple() and numpy.concatenate(). We create a linearly interpolated distribution function as before, and sample from the distribution using a random number and the interpolated function, and obtain the corresponding item ID.

Note that extrapolation is a powerful technique but can also be risky if the underlying distribution changes significantly beyond the range of observed data. You should validate the extrapolated probabilities using additional data or domain knowledge if possible, and adjust the extrapolation technique or function accordingly.
